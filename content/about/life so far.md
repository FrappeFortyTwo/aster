## Who Am I ?

I am a maker. I like to take things apart, and see how they work, see their shortcomings and maybe even add a personal touch. I am passionate about engineering and design. I stress on design that complements the engineering aspect and vice versa.

I like to chase learning curves revolving computer science, programming, robotics and digital art. Beyond that, I’m probably spending time with family and friends, reading, sketching, strolling, playing basketball or tinkering on my next side project.

A Minimalist who likes to code.

## Life So Far ...

I grew up in Ranchi. A small city surrounded by waterfalls, where I spent most of my childhood days on the computer. I was only 10 years old so I guess, it was natural to get sucked into the rabbit hole of computers and the digital world.

I spent the next few years working on everything from, making sketches, burning CDs, 2d animation on flash, making autorun programs for CDs I burnt, custom voice recognition commands in xml, HTML websites, making cross-over ethernet cable ( you name it ). Other times I was busy playing video games. In the process I broke my system multiple times, and soon learnt to do repairs myself. ( It was more educated guesses than hardcore repair . haha. ) But hardware diagnosis intrigued me, I was still in middle school, had no idea about electrons so computing was magical to me.

Fast forward to the early years of my high school, a friend showed me how he had soldered some leds to a motor which had a handle attached to it’s shaft. Rotating the handle made the leds light up ( dynamo generator ). We had no idea how it worked but It seemed so cool ! So I spent the next few months, practicing soldering on simple circuits / old pc components while looking into more components, tutorials, DIY books. Months later( Internet was not mainstream back then ) I found an article about the arduino . The idea of being able to program hardware was astonishing. And that took my hardware hacking to the next level.

After high school, I moved to the Pink City for college. Where I loved studying electronic devices and circuits, circuit design, algorithms, design principles and more. This was where, over years I transitioned from being a serious enthusiast to a hardcore programmer. After a decade long pursuit, my heart continues to seek this adventure. And I finally feel confident calling myself a maker.
