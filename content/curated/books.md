Before cinema ruined it. This book was a light science fiction. Pretty great for it's time. But now given the phelothra
of sci-fi content we have. This might nnnnot impress you. Although it's a great book ( especially for young readers )

10. Fyodor Dostoyevsky : Crime and Punishment

Have you ever killed someone ? Do you want to ? This book will take you inside the mind

    I've loved this book. Surely it is more relevant now then ever. No just the fact that we are being watched by corporate giants but how fake information & propaganda is spread today, ministry of love ? yep.

19. George Orwell : Animal Farm

    This can be your first book, if you're starting to read. You will either get a good story about animals or
    maybe ( sooner or later ) how this small book reflects society and hierarchy. Either way, it's a fun read.
