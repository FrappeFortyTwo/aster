## Finding Your Art Style

* Goal : To create minimal cartoon styled funny comic strips with incidents / one liners.

|        Aspect         | Status |                           Remarks                            |
| :-------------------: | :----: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
| Character Development |   No   | The comic will revolve around the experiences of a fixed protagonist. |
|         Plot          |   No   | No story to be told here. Just funny newspaper style one-liner comics. |
|         World         |   No   | The background will only include objects / characters the protagonist interacts. |

### Tips 

* Use layers for shadow & lighting instead of painting it.
  * Copy a layer of your work.
  * Put it above your original layer.
  * Reduce the brightness.
  * Erase where you want light with transparency locked.
