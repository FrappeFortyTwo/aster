## Week Days



## 7 : 30

* **Wake Up & Scribble**

  After waking up, write down what you will be working on today until you run out of ideas. Prioritise your tasks as per Eisenhower Matrix :

|                   |   URGENT   | NOT URGENT  |
| :---------------: | :--------: | :---------: |
|   **IMPORTANT**   |    `Do`    | `Schedule`  |
| **NOT IMPORTANT** | `Delegate` | `Eliminate` |

* **Hydrate & Stretch**

  After penning down your tasks for today. Get out of the bed and drink a glass of water. Follow this with a quick stretch and clean your room.

* **Shower & Eat**

  Take a cold soothing shower. Follow this by eating a big breakfast, this is your fuel for the day.



## 10 : 00

* **2 Hour Work Sprint**

  Start your work by eating the frog ( task that is important & urgent ).  Try to at least get done with a major portion of the task. After the 2 hours, take a break, take a walk or maybe have a beverage, give your brain some rest.



## 13 : 00

* **1 Hour Work Sprint**

  In this sitting, try to finalise your work. If some approach worked, incorporate it. The goal here is to make substantial progress with what's working because as they say `Best is the enemy of good`

  

## 15 : 00

* **Humble Lunch**

  After having worked for a few hours, have a good lunch all by yourself. No movies, web series or lectures. Just you and your food. Follow this with an hour long nap to restore your energy levels.



## 17 : 00

* **Free Hour**

  A dedicated hour for a healthy mind and body to workout and practice meditation.

  |   Mon   |   Tue    |   Wed   |  Thurs  |   Fri   |

  | Workout | Meditate | Workout | Mediate | Workout |

## 22 : 00
